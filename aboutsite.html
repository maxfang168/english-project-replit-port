    <h1 class="paragraph-wide">All Coding was manual (NO GOOGLE SITES). This allowed me to make more advanced animations
      and text. All coding and writing was done by Max Fang. The animations within the site took about 5 hours in total.
      This was because I had to manually code each one in. None of the code or writing within the site was generated by
      AI, or from a template. CSS & UX design took about 12 hours. JS animation code took about 1 hour, while logistics
      took 2 more hours. Site testing was performed across multiple devices, on different resolutions and zoom levels,
      taking about 2 hours. Image sourcing took 1 hour. Site review was performed by me and my parents, taking 3
      hours. Site planning took half an hour. Debugging took 3 hours. 1 hour was spent making the site look more modern.
      Researching the animations took 1 hour. Spell checking took 1 hour (my programming setup doesn't have a spell
      checker).</h1>
