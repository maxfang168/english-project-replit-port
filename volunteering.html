      <h1 class="title">Volunteering</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">I first started volunteering at a place called Camp Sunshine over summer break, for the purpose of fulfilling my 7th grade community service hours quota. After spending a day at Camp Sunshine, I realized that during the summer, there wasn't many better things to do other than help people. So, I spent several days over the course of the summer, to volunteer there. Eventually, Camp Sunshine closed for the summer, and I began searching for other placed to volunteer. Eventually, I came across a group called Jersey Cares. Jersey Cares was a volunteer organization devoted towards cleaning up parks in different areas of New Jersey. I ended up spending the whole day there, picking up trash. While I was working hard to collect bucketfuls of trash, I came across another group of volunteers, with about 6 people. They were just standing there, with their buckets, staring at their phones. Eventually, I learned that they did that so they could accumulate enough volunteer hours to get an award, and they were trying to get the award without putting in any effort. So, from volunteering, I learned that the world isn't fair, and there's always somebody trying to game the system.<p>
