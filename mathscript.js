I started to realise how being good in math can help you in your academic journey. For example, this year, the 7th grade Godwin science teacher had everyone perform a lab. Within that lab, we had to find the average of a dataset. The average, or the mean, is a mathematical function, and because of how it was used within the project, it demonstrates that math is used everywhere, even branching off into seemingly distant topics, such as science, or even art. For example, if you use a computer to make art, or even for general web-browsing, your computer is performing mathematical calculations billions of times per second to render the webpage, or to display your art. (On a chromebook, it\'s has a max of about 2 billion calculations per second, while on a typical consumer laptop can go up to 110 billion calculations per second (based on i7-14700HX). Because of math\'s prevalence within the modern world, I began to realise how importaint it math was. This piqued my interest in math, and I started to invest more time in it.'
